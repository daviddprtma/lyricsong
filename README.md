How to make a lyric song by ourself? It's easy to do that. Follow this step: </br>
1.) Clone my github repo by typing in your terminal -> https://github.com/daviddprtma/lyricsong.git </br>
2.) There will be a folder named build and inside there are 3 files that you can see -> index.html, jaz1.mp3, and vara.min.js </br>
3.) If you want to choose another song then you can simply just search in the google with the extension that support .mp3 (whatever the song it is) and save it to your place.
